🔧 80% of the configuration you'll ever need \
💻 Ready to go with GitHub Codespaces \
🚀 Quickly get up-and-running with a devcontainer \
🐳 No need to mess with a `Dockerfile`

## Usage

![Codespaces](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=Codespaces&color=181717&logo=GitHub&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)
![Devcontainers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=Devcontainers&color=2496ED&logo=Docker&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)

After creating a GitHub Codespace (or a devcontainer in VS Code), open the
Command Palette to find the <kbd>Dev Containers: Add Dev Container Configuration
Files...</kbd> command. After you run it, VS Code will guide you through the
creation of a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file!

Make sure you click the <kbd>Show All Definitions...</kbd> option to see our
unofficial templates!

Guess what? You don't even need to leave your browser to add a feature template!
Since these `devcontainer-template.json` files are just JSON files, we don't
need a full IDE with a terminal; all we need is a JSON text editor.
